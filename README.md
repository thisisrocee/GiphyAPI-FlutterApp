# Giphy API Flutter App

This Flutter application allows users to search and view GIFs using the Giphy API. It provides a simple interface where users can enter search queries to find related GIFs and scroll through the results. The app supports infinite scrolling, meaning that more GIFs are loaded automatically as the user reaches the bottom of the screen.

## Features

- **Search for GIFs:** Users can enter search queries to find GIFs related to their interests.
- **Infinite Scrolling:** More GIFs are loaded automatically as the user scrolls to the bottom of the screen.
- **Trending GIFs:** The app also displays a list of trending GIFs when first opened.
- **Responsive Design:** The app adapts to different screen sizes and orientations.
